# Data-Analytics-Portofolio_Supermarket-Sales
Hello, I just finished a data analysis project about sales of the supermarket. The data source I use comes from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales). I analyzed this data using postgreSQL and visualized it using google data studio. My dashboard is attached to the Dashboard.pdf file. For more details, it can also be accessed via the following link: https://datastudio.google.com/s/h4wU963cYVg 

Based on the analysis that has been done, the following insights and suggestions are obtained.

1. The company's total sales and margin income during January-March 2019 was around 322,967 USD and 15,379 USD For each branch: 
/n Total sales and income margin of branch A : 106,200 USD and 5,057 USD 
Total sales and income margin of branch B : 106,198 USD 5,057 USD 
Total sales and income margin of branch C: 110,569 USD and 5,265 USD 
The highest total sales and margin were obtained by branch A  

2. Sales Trend Line Based on the company's trend line during January-March 2019: 
-Peak sales for each branch occurred in January 2019 
-The lowest total sales for each branch occurred in February 2019 with total sales of around 116,292 USD  

3. Population of product sold The most dominated product of the company's sales during January-March 2019 for each branch were: 
Branch A : Home and lifestyle 
Branch B : Sports and travel 
Branch C : Food and beverage 
It is possible to supply large quantities of stock for high demand products, this is to maintain the company's revenue stream. Meanwhile, promotions can be carried out for product categories with low demand to increase sales of these products.

4. Rating Based on customer assessment, the average rating obtained by each branch is: 
A: 7.03 
B: 6.82 
C: 7.07 
Branch C received the highest rating, this is correlated with the total sales obtained by the branch. Therefore, to increase sales, it is necessary to improve service and customer satisfaction.
